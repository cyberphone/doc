A Critical Analysis of REST APIs for &quot;Transaction Systems&quot;
</div>
<div>
<i>Disclaimer</i>: This is not an
<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html" target="_blank">academic paper</a>,
it is simply a set of observations I have
made during my fairly long journey with Web (HTTP) based business systems.
You don't have to agree with it at all :-)
</div>
<div>
Since everybody in IT who haven't slept under a rock the last 10 years know, REST has become almost synonymous with
good Web API design (although most developers tend to refer to their designs as &quot;RESTful&quot; to provide
some latitude in the interpretation what REST actually is...).
</div>
<div class="new">
In spite of that, I have for a <i>certain class of applications</i> which we can
call &quot;Transaction Systems&quot;
come to the conclusion that REST may not always be the most logical choice for Web APIs.
The reasons are briefly described in the following sections.  Transaction systems (using my vocabulary NB),
for example include B2B order/invoicing and bank-to-bank payments.  
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">Web Services, SOAP, and XML are Obsolete!</div>
Indeed, after more than 10 years with SOAP, XML and XML Schemas, I have finally closed that door.
However, that's not equivalent to <i>&quot;Everything was wrong with Web Services&quot;</i> which
REST advocates often claim.
You can safely drop SOAP and replace XML with JSON, but <i>the underlying
RPC-concept still has plenty of mileage left</i>, which I have elaborated on a bit further down in this paper.
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">REST - Stateless Operation</div>
Stateless operation is great but transactions are typically not stateless so it is hard
to see that REST has anything special to offer here.
Existing, non-REST transaction systems usually do not depend on Web server state either.
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">REST - Asynchronous Operation</div>
This is a more complex issue but if I understand the REST philosophy correctly,
a slowly processing transaction request should not block until it is ready, but rather return HTTP&nbsp;202
and a header holding a URI to a location where the result may be queried for.
</div>
<div class="new">
IMHO, this greatly complicates the design in both ends; the server must
still continue with the processing (albeit in the background) including
dealing with possible time-outs, and then when a result is ready
move it to a handler for the previously calculated URI.
<div class="new">
For clients <i>that are not browsers</i>, but &quot;Business Systems&quot;, it gets worse;
after sending the request, the client needs to start a process for querying the result using
the previously received URI,
and finally pairing the result with the original request.
There may of course be a time-out here as well.
</div>
<div class="new">
To me this looks pretty much like reinvented SMTP, using HTTP and Web servers.
</div>
<div class="new">
Recent EU directives (SCT Inst) require payment transactions to finish in less than 10 seconds while
card network operations already typically take less than 1 second which (IMO)
does not motivate asynchronous operation between &quot;machines&quot;.
Of course there are some slow (mainly mail based), transaction systems out there which could benefit from a scheme
like above, but that does not (at all) imply that you need to buy into in the whole REST package as well.
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">REST - HTTP Bindings</div>
Although not directly related to our class of applications it is still worth mentioning
that REST is claimed to not be limited to HTTP. This may be true, but
it is not entirely obvious how a scheme based on <i>URIs</i>, <i>HTTP Header Parameters</i>,
<i>HTTP Verbs</i>, and an <i>Optional Request Body</i>, could be translated to other transports.
In fact, REST appears to be <i>incompatible</i> with
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6455.txt" target="_blank">WebSockets</a> which is another cool Web technology.
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">REST - Serialization</div>
A common feature of transaction systems, is storing transaction data.
Since the meaning (semantics) of a REST request is not uniquely defined by
the &quot;payload&quot;, a complete store operation would (presumably)
include HTTP verb, URI, and HTTP headers as well.
Quite doable but also rather messy compared to &quot;Old&nbsp;School&quot; self-contained XML messages.
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">REST - Signed Requests</div>
Believe it or not, but <i>there is currently no established standard for signing REST requests</i>.
</div>
</div>
<div class="new">
Well, when you look more closely into the matter, you will
find that a major hurdle is that a <i>proper</i> signature scheme should sign <i>all
elements</i> characterizing the semantics of a
request which for REST also include HTTP verb, URI, and HTTP headers,
making canonicalization awkward. 
</div>
<div class="new">
If you to the above add <i>countersigned</i> messages which are a useful feature in transaction
systems, you will likely end-up with an <i>ugly mixture</i> of JSON and non-JSON data.
</div>
<div class="new">
An example of a REST signature scheme used by Amazon.com: 
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-header-based-auth.html" target="_blank">
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/sig-v4-header-based-auth.html</a>.

<div style="font-size:15pt;margin-top:30pt;font-family:arial,verdana;text-align:center">
Another Take on &quot;Transaction System&quot; APIs on the Web
</div>
<div>
The following sections outline a scheme which I consider a viable alternative to
REST based APIs.
The code examples are given in JavaScript.
</div>
<div class="new">
Note: If you are looking for an API you won't find one because the core
is a <i>message-centric</i> concept, where &quot;self-sufficient&quot; messages are &quot;liberated&quot;
from redudant HTTP verbs, URIs, and SOAP envelopes.
However, nothing prevents you from mapping APIs into messages!
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">Sending Messages over HTTP</div>
Requests containing (JSON formatted) transaction data should be invoked by HTTP POST
while requests that only lookup existing data should use GET.
Successful requests including &quot;soft&quot; (handled) errors like
&quot;Insufficient Funds&quot; should return HTTP&nbsp;200,
while &quot;hard&quot; (non-recoverable) errors should return an applicable HTTP code like 400, 401, 404, 405, 500
plus a suitable text message for logging and debugging purposes.
</div>
<div class="new">
POSTed messages are preferably <i>idempotent</i> within their validity time to facilitate <i>secure retransmissions</i>.
</div>
<div class="new">
Below is an example of a POSTed transaction request:
<pre>
POST /transact HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: Java
Host: saturn.mybank.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 1234

{
  "@context":"some-name-space",
  "@qualifier":"some-object-type",
</pre>
<i style="margin-left:40pt">Additional Transaction Payload Request Properties</i>
<pre>
  "signature":{...}
}
</pre>
GET and POST responses follow the same pattern:
<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 9541

{
  "@context":"some-name-space",
  "@qualifier":"some-object-type",
</pre>
<i style="margin-left:40pt">Additional Response Properties</i>
<pre>
  "signature":{...}
}
</pre>
</div>

<div>
<div class="header">Message Serialization and Deserialization (Parsing)</div>
<table style="margin-left:30pt"><tr>
    <td><i> JSON String</i><code> = <span style="color:brown">JSON</span>.<span style="color:red">stringify</span>(</code><i>JavaScript Object</i><code>);</code></td>
    <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td><code><span style="color:grey">// I don't like complexity!</span></code></td></tr>

    <td></td><td><code><span style="color:grey">// Me neither :-)</span></code></td>
    </tr></table>
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">JSON Message Structure</div>
One of the requirements, which probably stemmed from (too) many years with XML and XML Schema,
was the ability recognizing the type of a message by including type information in the message itself.
This allows you to process different messages through a single dispatcher mechanism as well
as easing debugging and documentation.  The following message taken from the
<a href="https://cyberphone.github.io/doc/saturn" target="_blank">Saturn</a>
project shows an <i>example</i> of such a typing scheme:

In the message above the <code>@context</code> property is essentially a counterpart to an XML name-space,
while <code>@qualifier</code> sort of emulates an XML top-level element.
In Saturn, <code>@context</code> is constant while <code>@qualifier</code> denotes actual message type.
The point with having designated &quot;keywords&quot; for type information is that you can
automate object instantiation. If you don't need that, simply adding any suitable named
property works equally well.

A major advantage with typed (and self-contained) messages is that they become <i>transport-independent</i>,
allowing them to be embedded in HTML pages, sent over NFC,

<div class="header">Signed JSON (and JavaScript) Messages</div>
Here the project encountered serious problems since I had envisioned something similar to
XML DSig but preferably not depending on megabytes of fairly intricate library code.
IETF's JOSE WG recently defined a set of JSON-based cryptographic standards.
Unfortunately the JOSE signature standard forces you to encode messages in Base64Url
which does not only make them <i>unreadable by humans</i>, but also <i>disrupts the message typing scheme</i> :-(

Since existing JSON signature solutions did not fit the targeted scenarios,
a new signature scheme had to be developed which (completely unintentional),
turned out to be compatible with recent versions of JavaScript as well!

<div class="header">Message Handlers and Decoders</div>
The devised scheme does not specify whether all transaction requests should go to a single handler
(servlet) and URI,
but in the case a handler supports more than one transaction (message) type you need to dispatch
messages to the proper sub-handler.  This is trivial using typed messages:

<div class="new">

</pre>
</div>
<div>
<div class="header">Other Uses of the Messaging Platform</div>
Since the net result of the measures above, effectively is a &quot;Messaging Platform&quot;, it would
probably be interesting if it could be used for something else than just the original (rather narrow) target, right?
<div>
<div class="new" style="border-width:1pt;border-color:black;border-style:solid;padding:6pt 12pt 6pt 12pt;width:550pt;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto">
Due to the scheme's <i>transport independence</i>, <i>JavaScript compatibility</i>, and support for
<i>non-intrusive signatures</i>, it should be equally usable for entirely different categories of
applications, including client-centric security-related applications like &quot;wallets&quot;,
user authentication solutions, and credential enrollment.
